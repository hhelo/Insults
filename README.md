Insults
=======

[Source](src/) of insults, for a better planet.

Some insults may possibly be mind shattering, _insulting_ (of course!) and/or inappropriate. Use with caution.

Contributing

2. If it's your first time, add your name to [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS).
3. Send a pull request!

Conventions
===========

* Always make sure a name fits in the insult (if the original insult didn't have a part for this, try to add one and follow the general style of the insult).
* If you want a lowercase name, use {name}
* If you want a name as-is, use {Name}
* If you want an uppercase name, use {NAME}
