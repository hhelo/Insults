Insults
=======

[Source](src/) of insults, for a better planet.

Some insults may possibly be mind shattering, _insulting_ (of course!) and/or inappropriate. Use with caution. They can be smart, they can be based off of real things people have said (praise humanity).

Contributing
============

1. Add your insult(s) to [insults.txt](https://github.com/TheUnknownOne/Insults/edit/master/src/insults.txt) (click to fork the repository and open an editor).
2. If it's your first time, add your name to [CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/TheUnknownOne/Insults/edit/master/CONTRIBUTORS).
3. Send a pull request! (Go to "Pull Request" in your fork and click on "New Pull Request")

Conventions
===========

* Always make sure a name fits in the insult (if the original insult didn't have a part for this, try to add one and follow the general style of the insult).
* If you want a lowercase name, use {name}
* If you want a name as-is, use {Name}
* If you want an uppercase name, use {NAME}

Seriously?
==========

Yeah.
